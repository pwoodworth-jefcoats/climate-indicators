# Analyze data

## Convert weights from gilld & gutted to whole fish weights

Dealer weights are reported in lbs for gilled and gutted fresh, chilled fish. Here we convert their weight to whole fish weight using a non-linear conversion from *Langley et al. 2006* table 8. 

NOTE: Dealer data comes with a conversion factor (I kept it in the raw dataset) but it's fixed and for multiple entries it's quite complicated. I opted to use the Langley conversion here rather than the standard conversion factor reported because I felt it was most consistent and a better fit. 

NOTE 2: in 2024 Removing any records of negative NUM_SOLD. Total of 28 records, all in 2023.
-->
```

```{r}
#| include: false

dealer <- dealerRaw %>%
  filter(NUM_SOLD >= 0) %>% 
  mutate(Weight_GilGut=MEAN_SOLD_WEIGHT/2.204624, 
         Weight_Whole=1.274959*round(Weight_GilGut)^0.960613, 
         Year=year(REPORT_DATE), 
         Quarter=quarter(REPORT_DATE)) %>%
  uncount(NUM_SOLD) %>%   # unbin the binned records
  mutate(NUM_SOLD=1) %>%  # make a num sold column since it was removed during the uncount operation
  select(TRIP_NUM, REPORT_DATE, NUM_SOLD, Weight_Whole, Year, Quarter) %>%
  mutate(Weight_Whole=ifelse(Weight_Whole > 100, 100, Weight_Whole))

```

## Calculate Age
This is only used to mark the dashed age lines in the figure

Here we calculate the age of fish from the weight. First we use a Richards growth parameterization from an intergrated analysis in Aires-da-Silva et al. 2015 getting an length from age information:

$$L_a=L_\infty(1+\frac{1}{p}e^{-K(a-t_0)})^{-p}$$
where $L_\infty$ is the asymptotic length, $K$ is the growth coefficient, $t_0$ is the inflection point on the curve, and $p$ is the shape parameter related to the ratio $L_a/L_\infty$

Then we convert the length given from the growth equation above to a weight using data from Phoebe that she derived based on the Hawaii deep-set fishery. 
-->
```

```{r}
#| include: false

# using Aires-da-Silva 2015 Richard growth model using integrated data
a <- 1:7                    # age in years
Linf <- 200.8               # asymptotic length
K <- 0.44                   # growth coefficient
t0 <- 1.26                  # inflexion point on the curve
p <- -4.27                  # shape parameter related to the ratio La/Linf
La <- Linf*(1+(1/p)*exp(-K*(a-t0)))^(-p)

# Convert from Length to weight using Phoebe's numbers for the Hawaii fishery
Weight <- 0.0187*La^2.9605  # these numbers are from phoebe
WeightAge <- round(Weight)/1000

\
Rationale: Tracking the progression of growing size classes through time can provide a strong indication of recruitment pulses. The timing of these pulses is not yet well understood, particularly in terms of how they relate to climatic influences such as interannual variability. Improving this understanding could lead to the ability to project future yields and is an area of active research.\
\
Status: No above-average peaks in two-year-old bigeye CPUE were observed in 2021–2023, suggesting that there will not be a peak in the CPUE of four- and five-year-old bigeye in 2024 or 2025.\
\
Description: Quarterly time series of bigeye weight-per-unit-effort (WPUE) in hooks set is presented for the previous two years. Fish weights are those of bigeye tuna received at the Honolulu auction. The Honolulu auction reports weights for gilled and gutted fish. A conversion factor is used to calculate the whole fish weights used for this indicator (Langley et al. 2006). Note the quarterly (colored) and climatological (grey) distributions of bigeye tuna weight-per-unit-effort in @fig-wpue. Bigeye weights are from sets using $\ge$ 15 hooks per float.\
\
Timeframe: Quarterly.\
\
Region: Hawaiʻi-based longline fishing grounds.\
\
Measurement Platform: *In-situ* measurement.\
