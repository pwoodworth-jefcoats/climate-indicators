## Bigeye recruitment Index


```{r}
#| include: false
### Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(rje)
library(zoo)
library(here)

```

```{r}
#| include: false
# Set report year (RptYr), to make things easier
RptYr <- 2023

# Set path to variable: Median_Phytoplankton_Size
# This is where the data are and where the plots will go
Dir <- here('Fisheries_Indicators')
```

```{r}
### Calculate plot variables
# Summarize the logbook and dealer data on trip level and calculate number of small bigeye per trip

logbookTrip <- logbook %>% 
  mutate(TRIP_NUM=as.numeric(paste(LANDYR, sprintf("%04d", TRIPNUM),sep=''))) %>%
  group_by(TRIP_NUM) %>%
  summarize(HOOKSSET=sum(HOOKSSET), LANDYR=unique(LANDYR), LANDMON=max(unique(LANDMON)))

# This splits up large and small bigeye and groups by trip number
dealer$Num_Small <- ifelse(dealer$Weight_Whole <= 15, dealer$NUM_SOLD, 0)

dealer2 <- dealer %>% 
  group_by(TRIP_NUM) %>% 
  summarise_at(.vars=c('NUM_SOLD', 'Num_Small', 'Weight_Whole'), .funs=sum)
```

```{r}
### Merge and save dealer and logbook datasets
# Now we merge the dealer and logbook (logData) datasets since we only really need the effort information from the logbook.
# I did an `inner_join` here because I wanted to avoid having weight for sold fish (from dealer data) but no effort information for them (logbook data) or vice versa. 

# merge dealer and logbook since we only really need the hooksset info
dealerFinal <- full_join(dealer2, logbookTrip, by='TRIP_NUM')

# Check output
dealerFinal
```

```{r}
### Summarize by year
# Summarizing the joined dealer-logbook data by year and calculating running mean. Here we use a three year running mean that is centered on the middle year. 

# Raw data

\
Rationale: Catch rates of small bigeye tuna (≤ 15 kg) peak two years prior to peaks in catch rates (CPUE) and biomass (weight-per-unit-effort), indicating a recruitment pulse and allowing for predictions regarding increases in total catch rates of the fishery. The timing of these pulses is not yet well understood, particularly in terms of how they relate to climate impacts such as interannual variability. Improving this understanding could lead to the ability to project future yields and is an area of active research. \
\
Status: In `RptYr` 2023, the CPUE of bigeye ≤ 15 kg was **0.14 CHANGE THIS** fish per 1,000 hooks set.  This is the lowest value observed over the past 22 years (previous minimum was 0.16 fish per 1,000 hooks set) and at this time does not appear indicative of a strong recruitment pulse such as was seen in 2001 or 2013.\
\
Description: Time series of small (≤ 15 kg) and total bigeye tuna catch-per-unit-effort (hooks set) and weight-per-unit-effort (hooks set) for all bigeye tuna is presented. Fish weights are those of bigeye tuna received at the Honolulu auction. The Honolulu auction reports weights for gilled and gutted fish. A conversion factor is used to calculate the whole fish weights used for this indicator (Langley et al. 2006). \
