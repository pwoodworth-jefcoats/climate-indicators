## Oceanic pH

**About the Indicator**  
Oceanic pH is a measure of how greenhouse gas emissions have already
impacted the ocean. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean.
This leads to ocean acidification, which is measured via pH.

This indicator demonstrates that oceanic pH has decreased significantly
over the past several decades (i.e., the ocean has become more acidic).
Increasing ocean acidification limits the ability of marine organisms to
build shells and other hard structures. Recent research has shown that
pelagic organisms such as pteropods and other prey for commercially
valuable fish species are already being negatively impacted by
increasing acidification (Feely et al. 2016). The full impact of ocean
acidification on the pelagic food web is an area of active research
(Fabry et al. 2008).

**Status of the Indicator**  
The ocean is roughly 10.9% more acidic than it was 30 years ago at the
start of this time series. Over this time, pH has declined by 0.045 at a
constant rate. In 2021, the most recent year for which data are
available, the average pH was 8.05. Additionally, for the 6th year,
small variations seen over the course of the year are outside the range
seen in the first year of the time series. The highest pH value reported
for the most recent year (8.077) is lower than the lowest pH value
reported in the first year of the time series (8.083).

**Indicator Data**  
Description: Trends in surface (5 m) pH at Station ALOHA, north of Oahu
(22.75°N, 158°W), collected by the Hawaiʻi Ocean Time Series (HOT) from
October 1988 to 2020 (2021 data are not yet available). Oceanic pH is a
measure of ocean acidity, which increases as the ocean absorbs carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere. Lower pH values represent greater acidity.
Oceanic pH is calculated from total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved
inorganic carbon (DIC). Total alkalinity represents the ocean’s capacity
to resist acidification as it absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> and the amount of
CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed is captured through measurements of DIC. The
multi-decadal time series at Station ALOHA represents the best available
documentation of the significant downward trend in oceanic pH since the
time series began in 1988. Oceanic pH varies over both time and space,
though the conditions at Station ALOHA are considered broadly
representative of those across the Western and Central Pacific’s pelagic
fishing grounds.

Timeframe: Monthly.

Region/Location: Station ALOHA: 22.75°N, 158°W.

Measurement Platform: *In-situ* station.
